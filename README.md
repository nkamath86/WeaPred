Website created as part of CSE 586 - Distributed Systems course. This website takes the start and destination as inputs from users and then displays the route on a map along with the weather information of all the cities en-route. It contains MySQL implementation code that takes care of caching of queries using a MySQL database.

To run these files you need to install the LAMPP or XAMPP stack. I used LAMPP stack but MAMPP, XAMPP or WAMPP may also be used. Just make sure to use Apache Server and MySQL. I used MariaDB for MySQL.

For running the site on localhost, start the Apache server and MySQL database, and go to localhost/WeaPred/client.php Enter the start and destination locations and hit "Submit". For the first time, the website queries the APIs for the directions and weather. The directions are stored in the MySQL database for caching purposes. We can go back to the client page from the server page using the "Go Back" button. When the same start and destination locations are given as input, the directions from the MySQL database are retrieved and only the Weather API is queried for the latest weather information.
